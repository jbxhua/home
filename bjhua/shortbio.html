            My research focuses on polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), a toxic class of chemicals, in the environment. PCBs are carcinogens, neurotoxins, and endocrine disruptors. Because of their harmful effects, these chemicals were banned from production in the US in the late 1970s. Yet we still have PCB contamination throughout the both the natural and built environment decades later because their persistent properties make them highly resistant to degradation. My overarching goal is to contribute towards increasing our understanding of where PCBs are found and inform remediation strategies. My current work focuses on identify sources of PCBs in schools to reduce childrenâ€™s exposure to these harmful chemicals. For the past few years, I have been studying PCBs in schools throughout the state of Vermont in collaboration with the Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation and the Vermont Department of Health. We have deployed passive air samplers and passive emission samples in 19 schools. So far, over 400 samples have been analyzed, making this study the most comprehensive assessment of PCBs in schools to date. The data generated in this study have been used to help inform government officials and schools of where major sources of PCBs reside in their buildings and resulted in remediative and mitigative actions.
