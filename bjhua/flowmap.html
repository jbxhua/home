      <h4>Places that attract (receive) the most flows, and the places that send the most flows</h4>

        <p>
        Places that receive the most flows are generally the largest cities, as expected. These are major
        cities like Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen etc. Beijing seems to have the highest flows in and out
        because it is located right next to two other major cities. Most of the movement is concentrated
        in the eastern side of the country where the largest cities are located. This is expected as most of
        the population is located in the east-central to eastern part of the country. There are also larger
        flows along the eastern coast compared to the west and central parts of the country. Interestingly,
        the flows between the western side of the country and eastern side are very low. The western side
        is also mostly inhabited by ethnic minority groups such as Tibetans and Uyghur.
        </p>

        <h4>General direction of flows (e.g., north-south, east-west, etc.) with context to the
        geography of the flow data set</h4>

        <p>Generally, movement follows a north-south direction. There is little flow from the western side
        of the country to the eastern side. This is likely because of large differences in population
        densities and terrain between the western and eastern side.</p>

        <h4>Flow patterns in relation to location characteristics displayed by node symbol and
            choropleth base map</h4>

        <p>There doesnâ€™t seem to be discernable patterns in net-flow. The largest cities such as Beijing and
            Shanghai generally had negative net-flows. Sichuan was one of the cities with a relatively high
            net-flow, 650,000. More information must be known about each city and/or province to pinpoint
            why these flow patterns exist.</p>
